Example usage of this tool: email_scrapper.py [domain.name with protocol] 
i.e= email_scrapper.py https://hackemezzz.com

It will work for most of the http websites which do not have certificates and improper security
Note: this tool will not work without protocols (http or https) and with IP addresses you have to specify domain name only.

Thanks :)
